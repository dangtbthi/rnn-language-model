# RNN-based Language Model

## Project Overview
This repository outlines a vanilla **RNN-based language model** in PyTorch.  
The current focus is on architectural understanding; no full implementation or training has been done yet.

## Progress
- Studied the LSTM model but not implemented.

## Future Work
- Implement LSTM/GRU for text modeling tasks
- Extend to encoder-decoder architectures as groundwork for attention and transformers
